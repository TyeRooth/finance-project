# stocks-project

This was a project that I completed during one of my online courses. This project was meant to test my ability with Python, Django, and Flask.  The project is meant to mimic a stock trading app.  The app included functionality for getting quotes on stocks, buying stocks (not actually), selling stocks, and seeing a history of your stock purchases.  As well, there was full login functionality with the app.

I programmed all of the information in app.py after line 45 as well as all the templates files with the exception of layout.html.  The course provided helpers.py, styles.css, and layout.html.  The program requires an API key from the IEX exchange in order to run through Flask properly.  As well, this does require the course's library to run the often-used SQL functions.
